# 2020realtorCollaborationCenter
a little helper to deal with the awful collaboration center we got from our realtor

Requirements:
python stuff, a maps embed google api key.
The google api key should be stored as a js variable called "googleApiKey" in a file named "googleApiKey.js"

STEP 1:
get the json response from the collaboration center and save it in the "jsonRequest.txt" file

STEP 2:
execute the collabCenter.py script. It takes a while to load as you can't hit rew.ca too quickly or requests will start getting ignored

STEP 3:
open the collab center.html
